# Tell Me Why

This App is gateway to  interrupt automatic digital habits. In a world where it's easy to slip into endless scrolling, this app introduces a moment of pause  a simple, thoughtful question: "Why are you opening that app?" By prompting users to reflect before engaging with potentially distracting apps, TellMeWhy encourages greater self-awareness and intentional use of technology. It's a small moment that can lead to more focused decisions, helping users break patterns of mindless usage.

The result is improved focus, reduced digital fatigue, and a more mindful relationship with your device â€” one that supports your productivity, not undermines it.
